      As one of the country's most respected Asian chefs, Makoto "Mako" Tanaka is living his dream as the Executive Chef of his
      own restaurant, Mako, in Beverly Hills.  An innovator in Asian-style cuisine, the superstar chef describes his cooking
      style as "his own Asian-style," which is a combination of contemporary Asian cooking with Mako's personal touch.

      "Nobody does it the same way I do," says the former Executive Chef of Spago and Chinois on Main.  Using fresh,
      high-quality ingredients, Tanaka creates clean, flavorful contemporary Asian cuisine with a Mediterranean influence.
      What sets Tanaka's culinary style apart is his ability to create European-style sauces without using a lot of butter
      and creme.  The end result is that the inherent flavors shine through instead of being masked by rich and heavy butter
      sauces.

      Tanaka first began to develop his culinary style at his grandparent's restaurant in Kyoto, Japan, during his teen years.
      Later, the young chef packed his bags and moved to Los Angeles.  Under the guidance of Wolfgang Puck, Tanaka helped open
      Chinois on Main, then moved to New York to head the kitchen at the critically acclaimed China Grill.  Puck later lured
      the in-demand chef back to Los Angeles, where Tanaka served as executive chef at Spago and then helmed the kitchens at
      Chinois for seven years.

      While Tanaka credits Puck as a strong influence in his culinary career, he also points to Nobu Matsuhisa as a mentor
      and friend.  "I admire his work," says Tanaka.  "I also admire Thomas Keller [of Napa's French Laundry].  I like people
      who do their own, original food."

      After 16 years of working with Wolfgang Puck in the restaurant business, Lisa Brady has joined forces with Makoto
      Tanaka, to open Mako in Beverly Hills.  While Tanaka mans the kitchen, Brady is in charge of making sure the front of
      the restaurant runs smoothly.  From greeting guests to creating the artistic flower arrangements, Brady is involved in
      all aspects of the restaurant's daily operations.

      Brady helped design the restaurant with Tanaka and create its award-winning wine list.  "I've been in the business for
      many years, so I wanted to help make it happen and bring whatever knowledge I could to this venture," she says.  "I
      started in the restaurant business because I was in the acting business and I basically needed to have my days free
      for auditions.  Over the years, I got promoted, and it turned into a really solid job for me."

      Eventually, Brady gave up acting and began to focus her artistic talents on writing and painting.  In fact, her
      paintings are on display at Matsuhisa and at Mako, and the gifted artisan also designed the restaurant's logo and
      menus.  "The menus are made of wood, and they have my paintings on the front," she explains.  "And each one is
      different, because they are rustically handmade."

      Away from the restaurant, Brady jokes that Mako's passion is golf, and that she likes to work with her flowers and
      paint.  Brady has her own floral design and consulting business called Dogwoods.  Her specialization is in centerpiece
      design for weddings, parties and special events.  She has worked with many industry event planners and wedding
      coordinators.
